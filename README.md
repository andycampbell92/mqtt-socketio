mqtt-socketio
=============

An MQTT javascript client that uses websockets and falls back to socket.io when websockets not available.

Notes:
A socket.io bridge must be run elsewhere for this to work.

This was created for personal but I am happy to answer questions an do more work on it if anyone wants. Just drop me an email - andycampbell92@gmail.com
